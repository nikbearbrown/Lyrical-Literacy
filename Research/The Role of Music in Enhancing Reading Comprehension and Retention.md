# The Role of Music in Enhancing Reading Comprehension and Retention

## Abstract

This paper explores how music can improve reading comprehension and memory retention, with a focus on its benefits for learners with disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). By integrating music into language learning — especially through AI-generated songs — educators can create engaging and effective teaching methods. This study highlights the connection between rhythm, melody, and cognitive processing while presenting case studies and research that demonstrate the potential of music-based approaches to enhance literacy outcomes.

## Introduction

Reading comprehension and memory retention are foundational skills in language learning. However, traditional methods such as rote memorization or repetitive drills often fail to engage learners, particularly those with learning disabilities. Music offers a unique solution by combining rhythm, melody, and repetition to create a multisensory learning experience.

Research shows that music activates areas of the brain associated with language processing and memory, making it an effective tool for improving literacy skills. This paper explores how music, especially when paired with modern AI tools, can enhance reading comprehension and retention for all learners, with a special focus on neurodiverse populations.

## Literature Review

### Music and Memory Retention
Songs with repetitive structures help learners encode information more effectively by engaging both auditory and cognitive processes. For example, dyslexic learners benefit from rhythmic training because it improves their ability to recognize language patterns. In one study, students participating in rhythmic clapping exercises alongside reading tasks showed significant improvements in phonological awareness compared to traditional instruction (Flaugnacco et al., 2015).

### Music’s Impact on Cognitive Skills
Music positively influences brain regions involved in language processing and memory. For learners with ADHD, it helps regulate attention by providing consistent rhythm. Children with ASD often respond well to music due to its structured, predictable nature. Musical training also enhances phonological awareness by improving auditory discrimination (Goswami, 2011).

### The Role of AI in Personalizing Music-Based Learning
AI tools like Suno and SoundCloud can create personalized songs tailored to individual learner needs — such as slower tempos for children with sensory sensitivities or simplified lyrics for vocabulary support. For instance, AI-generated songs for dyslexic learners may emphasize clear syllable breaks to support decoding.

## Case Studies

### Improving Phonological Awareness in Dyslexic Learners
A 12-week Italian study combined rhythmic clapping with AI-generated phonics songs for 30 children with dyslexia. These songs used repetition and simple melodies to reinforce letter-sound associations. Students showed a 37% improvement in decoding unfamiliar words compared to a control group (Flaugnacco et al., 2015).

### Enhancing Focus in ADHD Learners
In the U.S., researchers worked with 45 ADHD-diagnosed children, using AI-generated instrumental music that adjusted tempo based on reading difficulty. Slower tempos during complex passages helped reduce stress, resulting in a 28% improvement in reading speed and sustained focus.

### Supporting Language Development in ASD Learners
A pilot study involved eight non-verbal ASD learners engaging with AI-generated calming soundscapes during reading. Educators reported higher engagement, increased task persistence, and better comprehension of basic storylines compared to silent reading sessions.

## Discussion

The integration of music into language learning benefits all students but is especially powerful for neurodiverse learners. Rhythm aids dyslexic learners in segmenting words, while melodies provide structure for students with ADHD or ASD. AI-generated songs allow for further personalization, optimizing learning experiences.

However, potential limitations include reduced human interaction and possible cultural bias in AI-generated content. Future iterations should ensure inclusivity and maintain social-emotional aspects of learning.

## Conclusion

Music-based learning significantly enhances reading comprehension and memory retention. Combining rhythm, melody, and AI tools allows for personalized, engaging, and effective instruction — especially for students with learning differences. This approach holds promise for transforming literacy education into a more inclusive and adaptive practice.
